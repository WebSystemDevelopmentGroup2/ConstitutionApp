                <p id="popup-text">Article I explains the US Congress, or the legislative branch of the government. 
                    The legislative branch is responsible for creating new laws and legislation. Article I begins 
                    by distinguishing between the Senate and House of Representatives. The House of Representatives 
                    has members from every state and the state population determines the numbers of members. 
                    The Senate is composed of two members from each state. The two different groups were established 
                    as a compromise between large states and small states who wanted different kinds of representation. 
                    The Article outlines how laws should be created in the legislative branch as well each group’s role 
                    in the process.

            </p>
            <p>
                Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the first Election,

                Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year,
                of the second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third Class

                Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House
                of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be

            <h4>Section 1</h4>
            <p>
                The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.
                He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice
                President, chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows
            </p>
            <p>
                Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a
                Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to
                which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative,
                or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be
                appointed an Elector.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two
                Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the same State with
                themselves. And they shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of the
                Number of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and certify, and transmit
                sealed to the Seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the
                President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of
                the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes
                shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the
                President, if such Number be a Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed;
                and if there be more than one who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of
                Votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately chuse by Ballot one of
                them for President; and if no Person have a Majority, then from the five highest
                on the List the said House shall in like Manner chuse the President. But in chusing
                the President, the Votes shall be taken by States, the Representation from each
                State having one Vote; A quorum for this Purpose shall consist of a Member or
                Members from two thirds of the States, and a Majority of all the States shall be
                necessary to a Choice. In every Case, after the Choice of the President, the Person
                having the greatest Number of Votes of the Electors shall be the Vice President.
                But if there should remain two or more who have equal Votes, the Senate shall chuse
                from them by Ballot the Vice President.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which
                they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United
                States.
            </p>
            <p>
                No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the
                time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of
                President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have
                attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within
                the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation,
                or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall
                devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by law provide for the Case of
                Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President,
                declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act
                accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.
            </p>
            <p>
                The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation,
                which shall neither be encreased nor diminished during the Period for which he
                shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other
                Emolument from the United States, or any of them.

                or Affirmation:– I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute

                of their next Session.
            </p>

            <p>
                He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the
